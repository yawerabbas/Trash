To solve this problem, we will use the properties of the normal distribution and standardize the value to find the required probability.

Given:
- Mean (\(\mu\)) = 10 cm/s
- Standard Deviation (\(\sigma\)) = 2 cm/s
- We need to find the probability that the velocity is 12 cm/s or more.

We will use the Z-score formula to standardize the value:

\[ Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \]

where \( X \) is the value we are interested in.

For \( X = 12 \) cm/s:

\[ Z = \frac{12 - 10}{2} = 1 \]

Now, we need to find the probability that \( Z \) is greater than 1. This corresponds to the area under the standard normal curve to the right of \( Z = 1 \).

The standard normal distribution table (or a calculator) tells us the area to the left of \( Z = 1 \):

\[ P(Z \leq 1) \approx 0.8413 \]

Therefore, the area to the right of \( Z = 1 \) is:

\[ P(Z > 1) = 1 - P(Z \leq 1) \]

\[ P(Z > 1) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 \]

So, the probability that a randomly selected train would have a velocity of 12 cm/s or more is approximately \( 0.1587 \) or 15.87%.

In LaTeX, the solution can be written as:

\[
\begin{align*}
\text{Given:} & \\
\mu & = 10 \, \text{cm/s} \\
\sigma & = 2 \, \text{cm/s} \\
X & = 12 \, \text{cm/s} \\
\text{Z-score:} & \\
Z & = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{12 - 10}{2} = 1 \\
\text{Probability:} & \\
P(Z > 1) & = 1 - P(Z \leq 1) \\
P(Z > 1) & = 1 - 0.8413 \\
P(Z > 1) & \approx 0.1587
\end{align*}
\]

Therefore, the approximate probability that the sampled train would have a velocity of 12 cm/s or more is \( 0.1587 \) or 15.87%.
